 * To start, look at your Arduino board and define the connections. 
 * Look at the number on the board next to the wires you've connected.

/* Some useful Arduino functions:
 * digitalWrite - writes HIGH or LOW value to a pin
 * digitalRead - reads HIGH or LOW value from a pin
 * analogWrite - writes an analog value (=continous value so eg. 0.23529 instead of just 0 and 1) to a pin
 * analogRead - reads the value from a pin 
 * It converts received input voltages between 0-5V into integer values between 0 and 1023.
 * That's why we used 'int' (=integer) to define our variables
 * 
 * Now, put your main code here, to be run repeatedly (=to loop):
